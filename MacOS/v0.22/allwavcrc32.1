.SH "NAME"
allwavcrc32 \- Script that uses the wavcrc32 program to check the CRC of audio data of any number of wav files in the current folder.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B cd music_folder && allwavcrc32
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR allwavcrc32
and
.BR wavcrc32
commands.
.PP 
.B wavcrc32
a program for checking CRC audio data obtained using EAC (Exact Audio 
Copy) on Windows, Rubyripper on Linux, XLD (X Lossless Decoder) on macOS, etc.
.PP
Before checking, the FLAC APE WAVPACK should be unpacked to WAV. At least one 
of the checksums obtained using wavcrc32 must match the checksums from the rip 
LOG file.

.PP
Using wavcrc32 to check the CRC of audio data in a track-by-track rip is very 
inconvenient because it can only work with a single wav file.
.PP
For example, if you enter the command 
.B \(dqwavcrc32 *.wav\(dq
in your music folder, which contains more than one wav file, the program will 
exit with the error 
.B \(dq*** invalid cmdline arguments!\(dq.
.PP
To calculate the checksum of all files in the current folder, I wrote this simple 
script.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBExample: To check the CRC of audio data for any number of wav files, use a script. To do this, navigate to your music folder and run it:\fR
.PP
.B cd music_folder && allwavcrc32
.PP
\fBOr run the allwavcrc32 script without options if you're already in the music folder.\fR
